# Word-Ladders

This is a Word-ladder generator that takes input from dictionary.txt. It reads the file, the driver code starts with a start and end word, and the program will find the ladder as well as enqueue count. This file contains it done with an AVL Tree, as well as a normal queue, this way you can see the difference in performance.
